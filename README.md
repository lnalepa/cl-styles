CL-Styles [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/creativelive/cl-styles/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/creativelive/cl-styles/tree/master)
=========

Contains creativeLIVE Less, and is used as a submodule in the Style Guide, and as an NPM dependency in Rind-based projects.



### Adding To & Compiling cl-icon-font

If you wish to add a new glyph to the icon font used in creativeLIVE you need to get up an running with `fontcustom`. In order to install font custom:

````
brew install fontforge eot-utils
gem install fontcustom
````

Add a .svg to the `modules/styles.mod/assets/icons` folder and then execute:

````
fontcustom compile
````

This should output a bunch of webfonts into `modules/styles.mod/assets/font`, as well as some templated css/html into an ignored folder. 

These files may be outputted as `cl-font-collection.*`, please rename it to `cl-font-collection(i+1).*`. 

Add your css rule to `icons.less` by picking up the unicode for your new character in the `.fontcustom-manifest.json` file, update the version of `cl-font-collection-N` and voila!


### Running Tests

In order to keep our css clean and tidy we use csslint to check for errors in the code. https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint. In order to run tests:

````
npm i
npm test
````
